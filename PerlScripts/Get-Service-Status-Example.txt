Here is what I used:

Win32::Service::GetStatus("", "service_name", \%status)

All information about the service is returned in the hash %status

Here is a list of the different values you can find the hash:

CheckPoint
ControlsAccepted
CurrentState
ServiceSpecificExitCode
ServiceType
WaitHint
Win32ExitCode


The key you are interested in is $status{'CurrentState'}

Here is the list of values returned by CurrentState and their meanings:

Win32Constant            Value    Description    
SERVICE_STOPPED           0x01    The service has stopped.    
SERVICE_START_PENDING     0x02    The service is starting up.    
SERVICE_STOP_PENDING      0x03    The service is in the process of stopping.    
SERVICE_RUNNING           0x04    The service has successfully started and is running.    
SERVICE_CONTINUE_PENDING  0x05    The service is resuming from a paused state.    
SERVICE_PAUSE_PENDING     0x06    The service is entering the paused state.    
SERVICE_PAUSED            0x07    The service is pausing.

Knowing the value of the state is important because it then let's you specify events based on what the service is doing.  

For example, say you want to install a program, but it requires that a service be stopped before the program can be installed.  You can issue a stop command to the service and then use an if statement along with a loop that looks for state 0x01.  If it does not find that state, keep looping until the state is encountered.  

The reason for this is services sometimes don't stop immediately.  There is a period of time when the service is stopping 0x03.  If you try to install while the service is in state 0x03, you will get an error.
